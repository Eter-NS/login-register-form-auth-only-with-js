Hello there ðŸ˜ƒ This is my little project in which I focused on using pure JS as the validation script.
The first attempt was to build it using sessionStorage as the database, but after I checked the net and
dug the answer where sessionStorage is not shared between sites even in the same domain (if I'm wrong,
please send me the article. I'm very interested in using this API ðŸ˜„). So after that I had to use any
API as the database for users. The script itself uses hash SHA-256 to protect user's sensitive data
while they are transported via HTTP protocol.

If you see something painful in my code, please send me a DM ðŸ¥° and then I'll be able to avoid that problem in the future.
